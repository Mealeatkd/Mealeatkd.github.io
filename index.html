    <p id="Bio">ជំរាបសួរ <i>Chom Reab Sur</i> ("Hello" in Khmer) and welcome to my personal blog. My full name is Rathanakmealea Mang, but people call me, Mealea. I was born and currently living in Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia.  I was born on the 24th of July, 2006. I did a little math, so I'm currently 13 years old. I'm currenly in my freshman year and my favorite subject is Math. I love to try new things, but still unable to find a specific area I want to focus on yet. Please visit other sections of the blog, especially the hobby section to find additional information about me.  </p>
